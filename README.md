# Review
If there are *.m4a* files in directory - "output" folder will be created in the directory and
converted *.mp3* files will be put in "output" folder, **this process is recursive, so pay attention where your script is located when you execute it**.

All converted *.mp3* files are 320 Kb/s bitrate.
